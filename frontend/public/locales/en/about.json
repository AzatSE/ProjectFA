    "text": "Hi there! Glad you stopped by.\nMy name is Firdavs, and I’m from Uzbekistan. I’ve been working in video production for over 6 years now. You might be surprised, but I started shooting on a regular iPhone SE — and I genuinely loved it.\n\nOver time, I left my automotive-related job and fully committed to the creative field. Step by step, I started investing in professional gear, growing, learning, and moving forward. Today, I’ve become the person I dreamed of being years ago.\n\nI completed training with Full Time Filmmaker and have collaborated remotely with companies and brands from all over the world.\n\nWe specialize in creating commercials and content for social media only.\nOur approach isn’t just about visuals — it’s about delivering a tool that helps businesses grow.\n\nOur clients include Hyundai, KIA, NRG, Cadillac, RedBridge School, Adm Aster, Silk Road Samarkand, and SKODA.\n\nNow, together with my wife Anita, we’ve built a small but passionate team. We put our heart into every project and are ready to bring your ideas to life.\nBest regards,Firdavs & Anita"
